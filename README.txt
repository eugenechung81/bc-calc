A simple version of the Unix utility ‘bc’.  The command ‘bc ‘ performs arithmetic on the command prompt.  The functionality is limited to the four basic arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/) and observes the order of operations.  

To run: ./bc.sh <expression>

e.g. 

$ ./bc.sh "1+4"
5
$ ./bc.sh "5/2"
2
$ ./bc.sh "5*4+2"
22
